# Breast-Cancer-Classification

There are two types of tumor :-
1.Begnig Tumor - Non Cancer , Slow growing , Cells are normal .
2.Malignant Tumor - Cancerous , Fast growimg , Cells are large .

-> '1' represents Begnig , '0' represents Malignant
->  Properties of cell are --
      1.radius_mean
      2.texture_mean
      3.perimeter_mean
      4.area_mean
      5.smoothness_mean
      6.compactness_mean
      7.concavity_mean
      8.concavepoints_mean
      9.symmetry_mean
      10.fractal_dimension_mean
